# WebBTCscSensorPlugin-public
 The Web Bluetooth Cycling and Cadence sensor plugin is is aimed at enabling and simplifying development of exercise, fitness and wellness games based on stationary bikes or bikes on stationary trainers. The plugin may also be used for development of web/hybrid apps or games for non stationary biking.  The plugin allows connecting a WebGL build to a BLE  (Bluetooth Low Energy) Cycling and Cadence sensor sensor supporting the GATT (Generic Attribute Profile)Â   profile CSCP (Cycling Speed and Cadence Profile). The plugin uses the Web-Bluetooth API  and the games/apps built with the plugin will only work on web-browsers that implement this API. Browser compatibility can bee found in this table: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Bluetooth_API#browser_compatibility. (Currently Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Opera1 and Samsung Internet support Web-Bluetooth, while Firfox, Android WebView, Safari and other iPhone webkit based browsers do not). The computer or device running the game/app must have Bluetooth 4 support. The plugin has been developed and tested with  Magene S3+ Speed/Cadence Dual Mode Sensor which may be oredered from the HelthGamez store. Examples of games using this plugin are available at www.healthgamez.fun/gamez
